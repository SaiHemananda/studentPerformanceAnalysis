##  📊 Student Performance Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of student academic performance, identifying key factors influencing outcomes and deriving actionable insights to support academic interventions.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To analyze the underlying factors affecting student performance in subjects such as math, reading, and writing, and identify trends and patterns that can inform educators and stakeholders.

## 📄 Dataset Overview
- **Student data:** Contains demographic, social, and academic information for students.
**Key features include:**
- gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education
- lunch type, test preparation course
- Scores in math, reading, and writing

## 💾 Data Source
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and widely used in education-related ML tasks.

## 🛠️ EDA Workflow

### 🔍 Data Cleaing
- Checked for missing values
- Removed or handled duplicate entries

### 📊 Univariate Analysis
- Distribution of gender, race/ethnicity, and education levels
- Histogram and boxplot analysis of scores

### 🔄 Bivariate Analysis
**Relationship between:**
- 📝 Test preparation and scores  
- 🎓 Parental education and student outcomes  
- 🍱 Lunch type and performance

### 📈 Correlation Heatmap
- Heatmap of numerical variables to detect strong linear relationships

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Test Preparation Impact:** Students who completed test preparation scored significantly higher.
- **Parental Education:** Higher parental education is positively correlated with better student scores.
- **Lunch Types:** Free/reduced lunch students generally scored lower, indicating possible socioeconomic influence.
